## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass



### What I learned

### Continued development

I really want to speed up the process with writing css code. I get a littel frustrated when seemingly simple tasks take a lot of time, it feels very inefficient.
