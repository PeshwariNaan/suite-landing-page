## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass



### What I learned

The major points for me in this project was learning how to use css filters to manipulate colors on svg images and learning how to make better use of grid orientaions for different screen sizes. I feel I got a lot of practice in 

### Continued development

I really want to speed up the process with writing css code. I get a littel frustrated when seemingly simple tasks take a lot of time, it feels very inefficient. 

### Useful resources

- [Css grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Great reference for css grid and flex-box
- [Css flex-box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
